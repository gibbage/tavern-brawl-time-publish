    "overview": "This Brawl sees players doing battle using custom decks using any class. At the start of the game, players are allowed to choose one from 4 of 6 possible Fate cards. Each Fate card puts into effect a special aura, affecting the game for both players. Fate card auras last for the rest of the match, and cannot be removed. Subsequently, when a player is reduced to 20 Health (Armor included) they are allowed to choose one from 4 of 6 possible Dire Fate cards. Dire Fate cards mostly also put special auras into play, but have stronger effects than the Fate cards.",
